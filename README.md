<!---I'm Hend Emad, a passionate individual with a strong interest in algorithms, machine learning, and their practical applications. Currently, I'm deeply engaged in my research on pathfinding algorithms, exploring their effectiveness in both static and dynamic environments.

I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on exciting AI projects that involve machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. I'm particularly interested in projects that require algorithm implementation and optimization.

If you're working on a project that aligns with my areas of interest, or if you're interested in discussing collaborations and sharing knowledge, let's connect and make a positive impact together!

I am a teaching and research assistant who has recently graduated from the Faculty of Engineering, Electronics and Communication department, with an excellent academic record (GPA: 3.43), ranked 7th among my peers. Here is an overview of my self-learning journey:

- 2021: Initiated learning C++ fundamentals, including STL, basic OOP, and data structures. Additionally, I practiced problem-solving on CodeForces.

- 2022: Delved into algorithms and honed problem-solving abilities on HackerRank, earning basic and intermediate problem-solving certificates. Concurrently, I pursued data analysis, learned through Udacity and Coursera specializations, and completed projects utilizing Python, SQL, and Tableau. Moreover, I ventured into teaching international students probability, SQL, and statistics as a data analysis instructor, while landing my first internship in data science.

- 2023 (Graduation Project - Embedded AI Medical Quadcopter): During my final year, I immersed myself in learning the YOLO algorithm and its applications. I explored path-planning and path-finding algorithms, and complemented courses in machine learning and motion planning. Additionally, I landed my first job as a CS teaching and research assistant at Nile University.
 
- 2024: Currently deepening my expertise in C++ and enhancing problem-solving skills through LeetCode practice. Engaged in research focused on algorithm optimization, and started to work as a C++ instructor at Route.
