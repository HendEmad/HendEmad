I'm Hend Emad, a passionate individual with a strong interest in algorithms, machine learning, and their practical applications. Currently, I'm deeply engaged in my research on pathfinding algorithms, exploring their effectiveness in both static and dynamic environments.

I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on exciting AI projects that involve machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. I'm particularly interested in projects that require algorithm implementation and optimization.

If you're working on a project that aligns with my areas of expertise, or if you're interested in discussing collaborations and sharing knowledge, feel free to reach out. Let's connect and make a positive impact together!"
